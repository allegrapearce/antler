# In sync: Synchronous disruption to female caribou antler phenology
This project details a companion analysis completed to investigate potential causes of abnormal antler phenology.

### Motivation
During routine fieldwork in the spring of 2024 our field team observed adult female caribou growing antlers while pregant, several months earlier than typical antler phenology. Notably we did not observe individuals with typical phenology that year, suggesting an external cue disrupted regular antler pathways. 

### Project Description
Using data from the Twilingate AUT environment canada weather station, we compare the weather during the focal year (with abnormal phenology) to all other years with field observations (starting 2017 to 2024, with the exception of 2020 and 2021). To do this we use a generalized additive mixed model to look at changes in mean temperature between years. Code to access weather data, run the GAMM models and create visualizations in the accompanying article (in review) can be found in code/03-climate-data.Rmd.
