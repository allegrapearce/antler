R download climate data from ECCC (for antler paper)

Need data from 2016-2024 for Twillingate AUT (Station ID = 7083, Climate ID = 8404025), hourly/daily.monthly data available
note: Twillingate station is not in use (was in the 1960s)

janky documentation for the API https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WJCDEU34c60IfOnG4rv5EPZ4IhhW9vZH
Or use weathercan package from ropenSci

```{r twillingate data}
library(weathercan)
library(tidyverse)
twillingate <- weather_dl(station_ids = 7083, start = "2016-01-01", end = "2024-07-30")

#write.csv(twillingate, "twillingate_weather.csv")
```

visualize the weather changes per year

```{r weather by year}
monthly_data<-twillingate %>% 
  
ggplot(twillingate)
```
